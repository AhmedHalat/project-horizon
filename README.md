## Project Video URL

**Task:** Provide the link to your youtube video. Please make sure the link works.

## Project Description

**Task:** Provide a detailed description of your app

A social network for game developers and 3d artists. Works similar to most social networks and allows posting, commenting, liking, user feeds, private messaging, and more.
The key feature is the ability to create and share 3d models.

Additionally, we want to be heavily feed and friend focused. So when you first register for the app you can subscribe to friends feeds and see an aggreated feed of all your friends activities (or view independent feeds).
Then, we want a messaging system that also allows you to create DM to your friends.

## Development

**Task:** Explain how you have deployed your application.

### Stack
Our techstack relies on NodeJS on both the front and backend. We decided to use Angular for the frontend library because of it's simplicity
and NestJS, Postgresql and Apollo for the backend because of their GraphQL support.
- Frontend:
  - Angular
  - Libraries:
    - Three.js (WebGL library for rendering 3d graphics)
    - PrimeNg & Bootstrap (UI library)
    - Apollo (GraphQL api library)
- Backend:
  - Nest.js
    - Apollo (GraphQL driver)
  - DB: Postgresql
  - Auth: Passport.js/JWT
